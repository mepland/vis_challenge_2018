Abstract:
This submission to the 2018 Scholars@Duke Visualization Challenge explored nature of interdisciplinary research at Duke through the study of Ph.D. committee membership for the academic years of 2013-2017. By combining the committee membership data with the faculty appointments directory, connections between different academic organizations were found and used to construct an undirected, weighted graph. From this graph communities of closely connected organizations were created via the Louvain method. The majority of communities fell along the typical disciplinary divisions, with a few interesting exceptions in Neurology, and Biology - Evolutionary Anthropology. Additionally, the level of interdisciplinary activity in each organization was measured by comparing the relative weights of their external and self connections, which showed potentially lower levels interdisciplinary activity in the Physics, Psychology and Neuroscience, and Philosophy departments. Lastly, future directions and areas of improvement for the analysis were identified, along with possible solutions.
